# WEB PORTFOLIO 2022

====================

> Hey guys!!!, I developed this portfolio using [**NEXT.JS**](wwww.nextjs.org) and [**TailwindCSS**](www.tailwindcss.com). While working on this project, I got to know some key points about development apart from the workings of the **TECH STACK** used. These are:

-   Always research about which tech tools would be best with respect to the use case.

-   I used _NEXT.JS_ for this project, but in retrospect, using a simple _HTML_, _CSS_ and _VANILLA JS_ combination would have sufficed.
